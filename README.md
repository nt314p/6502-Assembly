# 6502 Assembly
This repository is for storing assembly files for the 65C02 microprocessor.

I am currently building a homebrew 65C02 computer.

Planned Specs
- 65C02 CPU @ 1MHz
- 32 K RAM
- 32 K ROM
- 8x8 LED matrix display
- 4 buttons for input
- 9 I/O lines for additional peripherals

My computer design is largely based off of Ben Eater's YouTube series "Build a 65c02-based computer from scratch".

I highly recommend you go check his channel out.

For my assembler, I am using the Retro Assembler extension for VS code.
